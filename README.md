# Hey, I'm Karthick R ðŸ‘‹
A full-stack developer intern with a passion for building innovative web applications. Currently, I'm honing my skills in Python, Flask, and React, with a strong foundation in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. During my 3-month internship, I've worked on several projects, including e-commerce website, QR Code generator, CRUD application, Amazon clone etc.. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer. Available for hire and open to collaborations. Let's build something amazing together!
